<h2><ins>Elizabeth</ins></h2>
<p class = "body"> <b>My full name is Elizabeth Grace Louie.  My parents named me that in the hopes that I would be graceful.  If it's any indication of my gracefulness, I quit ballet after one year. </b>
<p class = "body"> <b>I attend Hunter College High School. Most of the time, you'll find me in the back of a classroom with my sketchbook.  Yeah, I'm that kid.  One of my  hobbies is drawing/sketching, specifically drawing people.  I also like writing and staring off into space imagining different situations and scenarios.  As an only child, these are the ways I've found keep me busy the longest.  I'm also a pianist and I've been playing for 8 years now.  I'm level 8 ABRSM and level 6 NYSSMA.</b>

<p id = "italic"> <i>Other random facts: I'm certified in basic life support from the American Heart Association and I can move my eyes independently (yet another thing I learned when I was bored out of my mind at home).  You can see one of my ink drawings down below: </i>
